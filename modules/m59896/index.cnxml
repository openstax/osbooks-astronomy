We can also measure its motion toward or away from us and estimate its rotation.</para>

<title>Clues to the Size of a Star</title>
<para id="fs-id1170324910382">As we shall see in <link document="m59897">The Stars: A Celestial Census</link>, stars come in a wide variety of sizes. At some periods in their lives, stars can expand to enormous dimensions. Stars of such exaggerated size are called <term id="term-00001">giants</term>. Luckily for the astronomer, stellar spectra can be used to distinguish giants from run-of-the-mill stars (such as our Sun).</para>
<para id="fs-id1170325375760">Suppose you want to determine whether a star is a giant. A giant star has a large, extended photosphere. Because it is so large, a giant star’s atoms are spread over a great volume, which means that the density of particles in the star’s photosphere is low. As a result, the pressure in a giant star’s photosphere is also low. This low pressure affects the spectrum in two ways. First, a star with a lower-pressure photosphere shows narrower spectral lines than a star of the same temperature with a higher-pressure photosphere (<link target-id="OSC_Astro_17_04_Pressure"/>). The difference is large enough that careful study of spectra can tell which of two stars at the same temperature has a higher pressure (and is thus more compressed) and which has a lower pressure (and thus must be extended). This effect is due to collisions between particles in the star’s photosphere—more collisions lead to broader spectral lines. Collisions will, of course, be more frequent in a higher-density environment. Think about it like traffic—collisions are much more likely during rush hour, when the density of cars is high.</para>
<para id="fs-id1170325079735">Second, more atoms are ionized in a giant star than in a star like the Sun with the same temperature. The ionization of atoms in a star’s outer layers is caused mainly by photons, and the amount of energy carried by photons is determined by temperature. But how long atoms <emphasis effect="italics">stay</emphasis> ionized depends in part on pressure. Compared with what happens in the Sun (with its relatively dense photosphere), ionized atoms in a giant star’s photosphere are less likely to pass close enough to electrons to interact and combine with one or more of them, thereby becoming neutral again. Ionized atoms, as we discussed earlier, have different spectra from atoms that are neutral.</para>

At bottom left is shown the partial disk of a blue giant, vastly larger than the white dot representing the white dwarf.

<title>Abundances of the Elements</title>
<para id="fs-id1170325084804">Absorption lines of a majority of the known chemical elements have now been identified in the spectra of the Sun and stars. If we see lines of iron in a star’s spectrum, for example, then we know immediately that the star must contain iron.</para>
<para id="fs-id1170325099511">Note that the <emphasis effect="italics">absence</emphasis> of an element’s spectral lines does not necessarily mean that the element itself is absent. As we saw, the temperature and pressure in a star’s atmosphere will determine what types of atoms are able to produce absorption lines. Only if the physical conditions in a star’s photosphere are such that lines of an element <emphasis effect="italics">should</emphasis> (according to calculations) be there can we conclude that the absence of observable spectral lines implies low abundance of the element.</para>
<para id="fs-id1170323202599">Suppose two stars have identical temperatures and pressures, but the lines of, say, sodium are stronger in one than in the other. Stronger lines mean that there are more atoms in the stellar photosphere absorbing light. Therefore, we know immediately that the star with stronger sodium lines contains more sodium. Complex calculations are required to determine exactly how much more, but those calculations can be done for any element observed in any star with any temperature and pressure.</para>
<para id="fs-id1170325450148">Of course, astronomy textbooks such as ours always make these things sound a bit easier than they really are. If you look at the stellar spectra such as those in <link document="m59892" target-id="OSC_Astro_17_03_Classes"/>, you may get some feeling for how hard it is to decode all of the information contained in the thousands of absorption lines. First of all, it has taken many years of careful laboratory work on Earth to determine the precise wavelengths at which hot gases of each element have their spectral lines. Long books and computer databases have been compiled to show the lines of each element that can be seen at each temperature. Second, stellar spectra usually have many lines from a number of elements, and we must be careful to sort them out correctly. Sometimes nature is unhelpful, and lines of different elements have identical wavelengths, thereby adding to the confusion. And third, as we saw in the chapter on <link document="m59791">Radiation and Spectra</link>, the motion of the star can change the observed wavelength of each of the lines. So, the observed wavelengths may not match laboratory measurements exactly. In practice, analyzing stellar spectra is a demanding, sometimes frustrating task that requires both training and skill.</para>
<para id="fs-id1170325257536">Studies of stellar spectra have shown that hydrogen makes up about three-quarters of the mass of most stars. Helium is the second-most abundant element, making up almost a quarter of a star’s mass. Together, hydrogen and helium make up from 96 to 99% of the mass; in some stars, they amount to more than 99.9%. Among the 4% or less of “heavy elements,” oxygen, carbon, neon, iron, nitrogen, silicon, magnesium, and sulfur are among the most abundant. Generally, but not invariably, the elements of lower atomic weight are more abundant than those of higher atomic weight.</para>
<para id="fs-id1170322774130">Take a careful look at the list of elements in the preceding paragraph. Two of the most abundant are hydrogen and oxygen (which make up water); add carbon and nitrogen and you are starting to write the prescription for the chemistry of an astronomy student. We are made of elements that are common in the universe—just mixed together in a far more sophisticated form (and a much cooler environment) than in a star.</para>
<para id="fs-id1170324943777">As we mentioned in <link document="m59892">The Spectra of Stars (and Brown Dwarfs)</link> section, astronomers use the term “metals” to refer to all elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. The fraction of a star’s mass that is composed of these elements is referred to as the star’s <emphasis effect="italics">metallicity</emphasis>. The metallicity of the Sun, for example, is 0.02, since 2% of the Sun’s mass is made of elements heavier than helium.</para>
<para id="fs-id1170325063826"><link document="m60004">Appendix K</link> lists how common each element is in the universe (compared to hydrogen); these estimates are based primarily on investigation of the Sun, which is a typical star. Some very rare elements, however, have not been detected in the Sun. Estimates of the amounts of these elements in the universe are based on laboratory measurements of their abundance in primitive meteorites, which are considered representative of unaltered material condensed from the solar nebula (see the <link document="m59870">Cosmic Samples and the Origin of the Solar System</link> chapter).</para>

<title>Radial Velocity</title>
<para id="fs-id1170322998243">When we measure the spectrum of a star, we determine the wavelength of each of its lines. If the star is not moving with respect to the Sun, then the wavelength corresponding to each element will be the same as those we measure in a laboratory here on Earth. But if stars are moving toward or away from us, we must consider the <emphasis effect="italics">Doppler effect</emphasis> (see <link document="m59799">The <term id="term-00002">Doppler</term> Effect</link> section). We should see all the spectral lines of moving stars shifted toward the red end of the spectrum if the star is moving away from us, or toward the blue (violet) end if it is moving toward us (<link target-id="OSC_Astro_17_04_Redshift"/>). The greater the shift, the faster the star is moving. Such motion, along the line of sight between the star and the observer, is called <term id="term-00003">radial velocity</term> and is usually measured in kilometers per second.</para><figure id="OSC_Astro_17_04_Redshift">
<title>Doppler-Shifted Stars.</title>
<media id="fs-id1170324934818" alt="Diagram illustrating the Doppler Shift. At bottom is the wavelength scale in nanometers (nm), starting at 400 nm on the left and progressing to 750 nm at right. Above the scale are three spectra, one above the other. The spectrum in the center shows a stationary object, with five hypothetical spectral lines shown at their rest positions. At top red-shift is illustrated with the same five lines each equally moved slightly to the right, or to the red part of the spectrum. At bottom blue-shift is illustrated with the same five lines each equally moved slightly to the left, or to the blue part of the spectrum.

<caption>When the spectral lines of a moving star shift toward the red end of the spectrum, we know that the star is moving away from us. If they shift toward the blue end, the star is moving toward us.</caption>

<para id="fs-id1170322704188">William <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004">Huggins</term>, pioneering yet again, in 1868 made the first radial velocity determination of a star. He
observed the Doppler shift in one of the hydrogen lines in the spectrum of <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">Sirius</term> and found that this star is
moving toward the solar system. (Better measurements now indicate that Sirius is actually moving away, but Huggins is still celebrated as a pioneer in making such measurements.) Today, radial velocity can be measured for any star bright enough for its spectrum to be observed. As we will see in <link document="m59897">The Stars: A Celestial Census</link>, radial velocity measurements of double stars are crucial in deriving stellar masses.</para>
<note id="derivin2" class="astronomy link-to-learning"><para id="fs-3333">In the <link url="https://openstax.org/l/30spectconst">Spectrum Constructor</link>, you can add absorption lines to the spectrum.

<title>Proper Motion</title>
<para id="fs-id1170325309803">There is another type of motion stars can have that cannot be detected with stellar spectra. Unlike radial motion, which is along our line of sight (i.e., toward or away from Earth), this motion, called <term id="term-00006">proper motion</term>, is <emphasis effect="italics">transverse</emphasis>: that is, across our line of sight. We see it as a change in the relative positions of the stars on the celestial sphere (<link target-id="OSC_Astro_17_04_Motion"/>). These changes are very slow. Even the star with the largest proper motion takes 200 years to change its position in the sky by an amount equal to the width of the full Moon, and the motions of other stars are smaller yet.</para>

<para id="fs-id1170325272832">For this reason, with our naked eyes, we do not notice any change in the positions of the bright stars during the course of a human lifetime. If we could live long enough, however, the changes would become obvious. For example, some 50,000 years from now, terrestrial observers will find the handle of the Big Dipper unmistakably more bent than it is now (<link target-id="OSC_Astro_17_04_Dipper"/>).</para>

</figure>
<para id="fs-id1170325044167">We measure the proper motion of a star in arcseconds (1/3600 of a degree) per year. That is, the measurement of proper motion tells us only by how much of an angle a star has changed its position on the celestial sphere. If two stars at different distances are moving at the same velocity perpendicular to our line of sight, the closer one will show a larger shift in its position on the celestial sphere in a year’s time. As an analogy, imagine you are standing at the side of a freeway. Cars will appear to whiz past you. If you then watch the traffic from a vantage point half a mile away, the cars will move much more slowly across your field of vision. In order to convert this angular motion to a velocity, we need to know how far away the star is.</para>
<para id="fs-id1170325067536">To know the true <term id="term-00007">space velocity</term> of a star—that is, its total speed and the direction in which it is moving through space relative to the Sun—we must know its radial velocity, proper motion, and distance (<link target-id="OSC_Astro_17_04_SpaceVeloc"/>). A star’s space velocity can also, over time, cause its distance from the Sun to change significantly. Over several hundred thousand years, these changes can be large enough to affect the apparent brightnesses of nearby stars. Today, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">Sirius</term>, in the constellation Canis Major (the Big Dog) is the brightest star in the sky, but 100,000 years ago, the star Canopus in the constellation Carina (the Keel) was the brightest one. A little over 200,000 years from now, Sirius will have moved away and faded somewhat, and <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">Vega</term>, the bright blue star in Lyra, will take over its place of honor as the brightest star in Earth’s skies.</para>

On the upper right is a smaller orange disk representing a distant star. A dashed, straight line connects the centers of the Sun and the star. (Above, to the left and parallel to this dashed line is a solid line with arrows at each end terminating at what would be the centers of both stars. This line is the total distance, d, separating the Sun and this hypothetical star.) Another dashed, straight line is drawn from the Sun, below and at an angle (shown as the Greek letter mu), from the dashed line that connects the Sun and star. The angle, mu, between these dashed lines is the measured proper motion of the star as seen from the Sun. In this case the star is moving to the upper left in the diagram. Three arrows are drawn from the center of the distant star. Each arrow represents the components of the star’s motion through space that contributes to its measured proper motion. The first arrow points directly away from the Sun toward the right, along the projected path of the dashed line connecting the Sun and star. This represents the radial velocity, i.e. the velocity along our line of sight. At a right angle to this arrow, and pointing up and to the left from the star, is the arrow for the transverse velocity. The transverse velocity is perpendicular to our line of sight, and is what we see as proper motion. Between the two arrows is a third, in this case pointing straight up in the diagram, that represents the total space velocity of the star. It is the combination of the transverse and radial velocities.">

The transverse velocity is a component of the space velocity projected on the sky. What astronomers measure is proper motion (μ), which is the change in the apparent direction on the sky measured in fractions of a degree. To convert this change in direction to a speed in, say, kilometers per second, it is necessary to also know the distance (<emphasis effect="italics">d</emphasis>) from the Sun to the star.</caption>

<title>Rotation</title>
<para id="fs-id1170324959985">We can also use the Doppler effect to measure how fast a star rotates. If an object is rotating, then one of its sides is approaching us while the other is receding (unless its axis of rotation happens to be pointed exactly toward us). This is clearly the case for the Sun or a planet; we can observe the light from either the approaching or receding edge of these nearby objects and directly measure the Doppler shifts that arise from the rotation.</para>
<para id="fs-id1170323090819">Stars, however, are so far away that they all appear as unresolved points. The best we can do is to analyze the light from the entire star at once. Due to the Doppler effect, the lines in the light that come from the side of the star rotating toward us are shifted to shorter wavelengths and the lines in the light from the opposite edge of the star are shifted to longer wavelengths. You can think of each spectral line that we observe as the sum or composite of spectral lines originating from different speeds with respect to us. Each point on the star has its own Doppler shift, so the absorption line we see from the whole star is actually much wider than it would be if the star were not rotating. If a star is rotating rapidly, there will be a greater spread of Doppler shifts and all its spectral lines should be quite broad. In fact, astronomers call this effect <emphasis effect="italics">line broadening</emphasis>, and the amount of broadening can tell us the speed at which the star rotates (<link target-id="OSC_Astro_17_04_Spectrum"/>).</para>

Below the spectrum a graph is shown, with luminosity on the vertical axis and wavelength on the horizontal. A curve is plotted which begins as a horizontal line about 3/4 of the way up the luminosity scale then dips sharply downward to near zero luminosity and then back up again to the original horizontal level. This sharp, narrow, and deep line is indicative of no or very slow rotation. On the top right another white disk is shown, with a circular arrow within, indicating its rotation. The left side of the rotating star is moving toward the observer, and the right hand side is moving away. The three wavy arrows are different than those for the non-rotating star. The rotating star’s left-most arrow has many waves representing short (blue) wavelengths, its central arrow has fewer waves, and the right-most arrow has the least waves representing long (red) wavelengths.

These rapid rotators spin so fast that their shapes are “flattened” into what we call <emphasis effect="italics">oblate spheroids</emphasis>. An example of this is the bright star <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00010">Vega</term>, which rotates once every 12.5 hours. Vega’s rotation flattens its shape so much that its diameter at the equator is 23% wider than its diameter at the poles. Another dramatic example is in the star Altair, which rotates in less than 7 hours (<link target-id="OSC_Astro_17_04_VegaRotat"/>). The Sun, with its rotation period of about a month, rotates rather slowly. Studies have shown that stars decrease their rotational speed as they age. Young stars rotate very quickly, with rotational periods of days or less. Very old stars can have rotation periods of several months.</para>

<title>Key Concepts and Summary</title>
<para id="fs-id1170325083773">Spectra of stars of the same temperature but different atmospheric pressures have subtle differences, so spectra can be used to determine whether a star has a large radius and low atmospheric pressure (a giant star) or a small radius and high atmospheric pressure. Stellar spectra can also be used to determine the chemical composition of stars; hydrogen and helium make up most of the mass of all stars. Measurements of line shifts produced by the Doppler effect indicate the radial velocity of a star. Broadening of spectral lines by the Doppler effect is a measure of rotational velocity. A star can also show proper motion, due to the component of a star’s space velocity across the line of sight.</para>

<item>The Voyagers in Astronomy feature on <link target-id="fs-id1170326186380" document="m59892">Annie Cannon: Classifier of the Stars</link> discusses some of the difficulties women who wanted to do astronomy faced in the first half of the twentieth century. What does your group think about the situation for women today? Do men and women have an equal chance to become scientists? Discuss with your group whether, in your experience, boys and girls were equally encouraged to do science and math where you went to school.</item>
<item>In the section on magnitudes in <link document="m59890">The Brightness of Stars</link>, we discussed how this old system of classifying how bright different stars appear to the eye first developed. Your authors complained about the fact that this old system still has to be taught to every generation of new students. Can your group think of any other traditional systems of doing things in science and measurement where tradition rules even though common sense says a better system could certainly be found. Explain. (Hint: Try Daylight Savings Time, or metric versus English units.)</item>
<item>Suppose you could observe a star that has only one spectral line. Could you tell what element that spectral line comes from? Make a list of reasons with your group about why you answered yes or no.</item>
<item>A wealthy alumnus of your college decides to give $50 million to the astronomy department to build a world-class observatory for learning more about the characteristics of stars. Have your group discuss what kind of equipment they would put in the observatory. Where should this observatory be located? Justify your answers. (You may want to refer back to the <link document="m59802">Astronomical Instruments</link> chapter and to revisit this question as you learn more about the stars and equipment for observing them in future chapters.)</item>
<item>For some astronomers, introducing a new spectral type for the stars (like the types L, T, and Y discussed in the text) is similar to introducing a new area code for telephone calls. No one likes to disrupt the old system, but sometimes it is simply necessary. Have your group make a list of steps an astronomer would have to go through to persuade colleagues that a new spectral class is needed.</item>
